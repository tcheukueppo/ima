ima is an extremely tiny command line utility which permits you to query search engines(e.g DuckDuckGo)
and download images from web pages.

ima might be a utility of choice for the following purpose:

- Downloading images from the internet to build up your dataset
- Searching on the internet with Google, DuckDuckGo or Yahoo. You would want to
  use multiple search engines to obtain better results.
- Caching your search results to later on use them locally.

# Installation
