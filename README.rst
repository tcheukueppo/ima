    Query with search engines and download images

ima is an extremely tiny library and command line utility which permits you to query search engines(e.g DuckDuckGo)
and download images from web pages.

ima might be a utility or library of choice for the following purpose:

- Downloading images from the internet to build up your dataset
- Searching on the internet with Google, DuckDuckGo or Yahoo. You would want to
  use multiple search engines to obtain better results.
- Caching your search results to later on use them locally
